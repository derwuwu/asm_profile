            I'm Lander, but everyone calls me Der for short.<br>
            A lazy person who always wonders how things are going to get done while doing nothing but lying in bed. I love sleeping, gaming, watching anime, and pretty much living on chocolate and coffee. I also enjoy watching game clips and vloggers who share tips and stories that make everyday life more interesting.
